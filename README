This program was written to create a keyword cipher stand alone app that can be run on the unix operating system.  

It was Developed using SBCL, and reads parameters from the command line

to compile this code load it into lisp
(load (compile-file "keyword.lisp"))

then 
(save-lisp-and-die "keyword" :executable t :top-level :save-runtime-options t)

this should produce and executable called keyword

usage is as follows

keyword {e | d} <keyword> <letter> <input filename>
use e to encrypt and d to decrypt

All output goes to standard out, use > the redirect output to a file if you wish
